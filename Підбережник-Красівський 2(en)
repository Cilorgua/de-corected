INFORMATIVE AND CULTURAL SPACE AS A FACTOR OF MODERN FORMATION OF NATION IN UKRAINE
Abstract (attention! Abstract and keywords translate in Polish and English)
The article analyzes the challenges to the Ukrainian nation formation and national security of Ukraine in the informative and cultural sphere at the present stage. The problems of linguistic self-identification of Ukrainians, the functioning of the informative and cultural space and its impact on the formation of Ukrainian national consciousness are highlighted. Threats in the information sphere in the context of Russia's hybrid war against Ukraine are determined. The subject of forming national consciousness through the system of national and patriotic education in Ukraine is investigated. The priorities of the state language policy, state policy in the information sphere and national-patriotic education in Ukraine at the present stage are defined in order to ensure the formation of the Ukrainian national consciousness and the Ukrainian civil nation, countering the challenges of the national security of Ukraine.
Key words: Ukraine, nation formation, language, culture, informative and cultural space, information security, hybrid war, mass media, national consciousness, national and patriotic education.

Most modern nations were formed primarily around the dominant ethnic group, which united other ethnic groups into a state entity and gave the name to the state and determined its cultural foundations. The ethnic core of a political nation makes it possible to create a inimitable and unique national identity, using the cultural and historical heritage of the titular nation - its ethnic core. 
Historically, the Ukrainian nation was formed precisely as an ethnic nation. The introductory passage of the Constitution of Ukraine states that the formation of Ukrainian state is based on the exercised  right to self-determination not only of the Ukrainian nation, but also of the entire Ukrainian people, which is formed by citizens of Ukraine of all nationalities1. This statement distinguishes between the Ukrainian nation and the Ukrainian people. The "Ukrainian people" are interpreted as citizens of Ukraine of all nationalities. This establishes the status of Ukraine, on the one hand, as a national state, on the other – as a multinational and multicultural one, and the Ukrainian nation is based on civil and ethnic components. The Constitution of Ukraine defines the Ukrainian nation, national minorities, and indigenous peoples as structural ethnic components of Ukrainian society. This statement can be considered as a desire to form a nation in Ukraine as a society based on nationhood from the people who gave the name to the state ― Ukrainians, and other ethnic groups living on the territory of Ukraine.
However, the processes of nation-formation in Ukraine at the present stage are negatively affected by a number of factors that deconsolidate Ukrainian society and blur national consciousness, including: the loss of the titular state-forming nation's ethnic identity based on the language factor, the heterogeneity of the informative and cultural space, the information war of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, the lack of an effective system of national and patriotic education and the formation of national consciousness. These are significant challenges to the Ukrainian nation and national security of Ukraine, so they require a comprehensive analysis.

PROBLEMS OF LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC SELF-IDENTIFICATION OF UKRAINIANS
Language is an important national and key factor of nationhood. Where the language disappears, the state disappears. There is a two-way relationship between language and identification. On the one hand, the use of language as a cultural meaning and marker is a consequence of identification, on the other hand, language is a necessary condition for a person's self-identification in culture2. Language acts as a way of correlating oneself with others in society, along with other socio-cultural features. The peculiarity of a language among such features is that it is the simplest way to express identity through a separate type of language3. It is in the language that the nation preserves its history, centuries-old experience, and cultural achievements. Language as a cultural apparatus forms not only an idea of the real world that surrounds a person, but also the individual himself. The latter, plunging into a certain cultural heritage, through language perceives traditions, customs, morals, the system of norms and values of its people, a specific cultural image of the world, gradually realizing its place in it. Language acts as the main instrument for cognition and fixation of cultural values, a guide of a person to the socio-cultural environment in which socio-cultural identity is formed4.
As noted by J.  Fishman, language is closely related to identity in three ways. In particular: 
- indexal, that is, the language is associated with a certain culture, it formulates statements and expresses the interests, assessments and worldview of the culture. This connection does not imply that a language that is traditionally or historically associated with a particular culture is ideally suited to that culture, and that another language will not be able to replace this traditional connection in the future. But in a certain period of time, no language other than one that has historically and intimately been associated with a particular culture is able to express certain artifacts and concerns of that culture so well5; 
- symbolic, which means that the language represents certain national (ethnic) groups with their own languages. The fate of languages is inevitably connected with the fates of native speakers of this language6; 
- the relationship of the part to the whole, according to which a significant part of any culture is verbal. In particular, the child's socialization models are associated with a certain language, cultural styles of interpersonal relationships are associated with a certain language, the ethical principles which are the essence of everyday life are correlated with a certain language, and even material culture and aesthetic perception are usually discussed and evaluated with the help of language figures that mainly exist only in this culture, and are not universal7. 
In Ukraine, unfortunately, some citizens who identify themselves as Ukrainians consider Russian to be their native language rather than Ukrainian, and are held captive by the Russian information and cultural space. This is evidenced by sociological polls conducted in March 2017. At that time, 90.6% of the population considered themselves Ukrainians by nationality. However, only 50.5% used Ukrainian as the main language of everyday communication8. This is due to the long-term lack of a proper state policy to support the development of the Ukrainian language, which, despite the state status, due to the favorization of the Russian language, in fact, for a long time occupied a secondary role in the socio-political life of Ukrainian society. This led to a number of negative trends in Ukrainian society, including:
- lack of self-identification with Ukraine in a part of Ukrainian society;
- lack of a complete Ukrainian-language informative and cultural space;
- dominance of a foreign (primarily Russian-speaking) cultural product in Ukraine;
- artificial politicization of the language issue, as a result of which the language is used as an instrument of political struggle and is the subject of manipulation;
- signs of discrimination against citizens in a significant part of the territory of Ukraine, where they are deprived or restricted in receiving services and content in the Ukrainian language;
- lack of Ukrainian industry terminology and proper vocabulary in many spheres;
- loss of linguistic identity of the population when moving to large cities and assimilating them in the Russian-speaking environment;
- low level of proficiency in the state language among representatives of national minorities, which does not allow them to properly exercise their rights and integrate into Ukrainian society;
- insufficient level of satisfaction of national, cultural and linguistic needs of Ukrainians living abroad9.
It should be noted that in conditions of Russian aggression against Ukraine, there was a significant increase in support for the status of the Ukrainian language as the only state and official language: if in May 2014 such support was shown by a third of respondents (34%), then in May 2019 – by the majority of respondents (65%). However, regional differences in responses persisted. The Western region continues to show the most active support for the status of the Ukrainian language as the only state language (87%). Supporters of the proclamation of two official languages in Ukraine are still concentrated in the South and East (34% and 27%, respectively)10. The introduction of the Ukrainian language as the state language is extremely slow in all spheres of public life, primarily in the Russified regions of the Left Bank and southern Ukraine, because, as noted by Y. Kuts :
- the processes of Russification are still continuing and are obtaining subtle forms; 
- language rehabilitation of Ukrainian citizens is deliberately slowed down in some places, and any expansion of the scope of use of the Ukrainian language qualifies as the displacement of Russian, arousing the question of the need to take radical measures to protect the latter;
- higher education has been russified, and the mechanisms for introducing the state language into the educational process are moving rather slowly;
- numerous corps of civil servants very reluctantly and weakly turns to the Ukrainian business language/ It is rare to hear the Ukrainian word in such spheres as sports, entrepreneurship, credit and financial sector and service industry, etc11.  
According to the analytical review "the situation of the Ukrainian language in Ukraine in 2017", published by the "space of freedom" movement, the service industry and the Internet remain problematic regarding the use of the Ukrainian language. According to the results of monitoring cafes and restaurants in 26 cities (all regional centers except occupied ones, as well as Kryvyi Rih, Mariupol, Kramatorsk and Severodonetsk), only 38% of food establishments have a sign in Ukrainian language; only 65% have a menu in Ukrainian and only 49% of establishments have staff serving Ukrainian-speaking customers in Ukrainian12. Such tendencies are observed not only because of the post-imperial inertia, but also because of the passivity of the still Ukrainian-speaking population. Therefore, the Russian language actually remains the dominant one. The complete dominance of Russian language in the business environment and media remains, as well as in the bureaucratic apparatus, and so on. Most of the large cities with their outskirts and a significant part of the latter remain by inertia postcolonial centers of russification from the old times of russian enslavement of Ukraine – Kharkiv region, Dnipropetrovsk region, Mykolaiv region, Kherson region13. 
Taking into account the language situation in Ukraine to regulate the functioning and use of the Ukrainian language as the state language in 2019, the Law of Ukraine "On ensuring the functioning of the Ukrainian language as the state language" was adopted14. According to the law, the status of the Ukrainian language as the only state language provides for its mandatory use throughout the territory of Ukraine in the exercise of the mandate by state authorities and local self-government bodies, as well as in other public spheres of social life, which are defined by this law. The Ukrainian language as the only state language performs the functions of a language of interethnic communication, is a guarantee of human rights protection for every Ukrainian citizen, regardless of their ethnic origin, and is also a factor in the unity and national security of Ukraine. 
According to a survey conducted in May 2019 Kantar TNS Online Track15, regional differences in relation to the language issue in Ukraine фку preserved. The Western region continues to show the most active support for the status of the Ukrainian language as the only state language (87%). Supporters of the proclamation of two official languages in Ukraine are still concentrated in the South and East (34% and 27%, respectively). Instead, age differences in responses are no longer significant. About half of the respondents have a positive attitude to the law of Ukraine "On ensuring the functioning of the Ukrainian language as the state language" (42%), a fifth of respondents (23%) showed a negative attitude, and about the same number are neutral (21%). 14% of respondents found it difficult to answer. The majority of respondents believe that the new language law contributes to the development of the Ukrainian language (39%). A fifth of respondents believe that the new law on language will not affect the use of languages in Ukraine (21%). According to 17% of respondents, the new  language law oppresses people's rights  who communicate not in Ukrainian, but in other languages. 14% of respondents consider the new language law to be a reason for disputes and conflicts. 9% of respondents found it difficult to answer. In the West, the new language law is generally viewed positively (61%) compared to the sample, while in the East and South it is viewed negatively (34% and 32%, respectively). In the West, compared to the sample, the new language law is generally considered favorable for the development of the Ukrainian language (55%), while in the South and East, more widespread concerns about the oppression of the rights of those who do not speak Ukrainian (26% and 25%, respectively)16.
According to the results of the national sociological survey of the Ilko Kucheriv Foundation "Democratic Initiatives" together with the Razumkov Center,  which was held from 13 to 18 December 201917, the Ukrainian language is considered an important attribute of Ukraine's independence. This thesis is shared by 81% of citizens (55% – "absolutely" and another 26% – "rather, yes"), and this is the opinion in all regions of Ukraine: Western (95%), Central (86%), Southern (71%), Eastern (64%). Also, the absolute majority of Ukrainians (80%) agree that all state leaders and civil servants should communicate in the state language during working hours (56% – definitely agree and 24% – rather agree). Regarding the state language of communication of civil servants during working hours, citizens of all regions are in solidarity: Western (96%), Central (86%), Southern (71%), Eastern (64%). In addition, the majority of citizens (79%) believe that at least half of the content in the Ukrainian media should be in Ukrainian (53% agree with this unconditionally and another 26% – rather, yes), and this opinion prevails in all regions: Western (96%), Central (82%), Eastern (66%), Southern (63%)18. 
Taking into account these problems of the language aspect of the Ukrainian nation at the present stage and public opinion on the status of the Ukrainian language as the state language, it is advisable to separate the policy of development, protection and ensuring the functioning of the Ukrainian language as the state language into a separate component of the state language policy of Ukraine. Implementation of national measures in the field of state language policy or solving local language problems at the regional level is possible only through a set of interrelated mechanisms for implementing state language policy, coordinated with each other by terms of implementation and resource provision. The state language policy should be aimed at promoting respect for the Ukrainian language and the languages of national minorities, and any manifestations of neglect are unacceptable. Priorities in the implementation of the state language policy should be: the creation of a proper legislative framework for state support of book publishing, mass media, song products in the Ukrainian language; ensuring the right of citizens to receive information in the Ukrainian language, including through print media (press), advertising, as well as to watch foreign films, dubbed or voiced or subtitled in the Ukrainian language; the development of the Ukrainian segment of the Internet and computer support in the Ukrainian language; improving the quality of Ukrainian broadcasting on domestic TV and radio channels.

PROBLEMS OF FUNCTIONING OF THE UKRAINIAN INFORMATIVE AND CULTURAL SPACE IN THE CONDITION OF RUSSIA'S HYBRID WAR AGAINST UKRAINE 
Issue of functioning of the cultural and information space are a component of the state's information security policy. Information security provides for ensuring high-quality comprehensive informing of citizens, free access to various sources of information, as well as control over the non-spread of disinformation, promoting the integrity of society, preserving information sovereignty, countering negative information and psychological propaganda influences and protecting the national information space from manipulation, information wars and operations19.
The modern Ukrainian Informative and cultural space does not sufficiently contribute to the formation of Ukrainian national consciousness. The problems of the language identity of Ukrainians have led to its heterogeneity. The consequence of this is a paradox when some Ukrainians identify with the neighboring culture, use someone else's language of communication and are potentially ready to support the aggressor in the event of an attack. Therefore, there are such trends in Ukrainian society as separatism, rejection of Ukrainian nationhood, symbols, and culture. These phenomena are widespread mainly in the territory where the Russian language dominates and vice versa: where the Ukrainian language dominates, such problems do not arise20. Such heterogeneity of the information and cultural space of Ukraine arose as a result of the anti-Ukrainian policy, which was implemented for a long time by state entities that included Ukrainian lands, in particular, the USSR. The centuries-old cultivation of the inferiority of Ukrainians as a nation, the displacement of the Ukrainian language from the spheres of Education, Science, Culture, Office Management, the reduction of cultural practices only to ethnographic manifestations have led to the fact that today the ethnic majority in Ukraine - Ukrainians - need more assistance from the state to develop their ethno-cultural features than national minorities. 
Today, there is a negative impact of information flows of foreign countries on the formation of the informative and cultural space of Ukraine. They are filled with information products that are alien to the Ukrainian nation in terms of mental values and ideals and not of the best quality, which blur the Ukrainian national identity, undermine the foundations of Ukrainian cultural identity, and act as a powerful factor in suppressing national consciousness. Within such an information space, society turns into an indefinite amorphous mass of consumers. 
The pursuit of easy profits of mass media owners and filling the pages of newspapers, TV and radio broadcasts, content of internet resources with low-quality products borrowed abroad, as well as deliberately distorted facts that often promote moral and political values that are alien to Ukrainians, contribute to the division of society21.
As a result, the informative and cultural space of Ukraine in modern conditions is one of the main factors of rooting in the public consciousness of incompatible value-symbolic systems alongside the lack of a well-developed own, Ukrainian one. In the minds of citizens, Western social values, beliefs in the European choice of Ukraine coexist simultaneously with a huge amount of Russian information product, which promotes other values and priorities up to cultural and psychological distancing from Western countries, a return to the “Soviet past”22.
In addition to the fact that the Ukrainian Informative and cultural space is unprotected from external negative influences, there is no Ukrainian national information product in the global media space that would distribute objective, unfiltered and up-to-date information about events in Ukraine. As a result, the world community experiences a lack of information or receives it from other sources, which often provide distorted, incomplete information. At the same time, the activities of the Ukrainian mass media regarding systematic, objective coverage of facts, events and phenomena are insufficient and lack strategic planning23. In addition, control over the key mass media of Ukraine, which are the main information channels of influence on public consciousness, is carried out by financial and industrial groups that do not always occupy a pro-Ukrainian national position, but act in the interests of foreign states, in particular, Russia. Such mass media carry out tendentious, prejudiced and pro-Russian activities. Such value disorientation hinders national progress and the formation of Ukrainian national identity. These trends are especially dangerous in the context of Russia's hybrid war against Ukraine. Russia is waging an information and psychological war aimed at inciting interethnic and religious enmity in Ukraine, calling for separatism, humiliating the Ukrainian language and culture, and distorting the information picture of the world. 
Six years of active communication and content aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine have shown that it is through the information space that the Kremlin's special operations are most powerfully conducted using the Russian language. The main focus is on the Russian-speaking population, separated from the Ukrainian language; twisting historical facts and denying the authenticity of the Ukrainian language, culture and the very existence of Ukrainians as a nation; the struggle for the establishment of the Russian language as the second state language and the displacement of the Ukrainian language from the media market; the use of Political Technologies and Election companies in order to delineate the regions of Ukraine, clash of interests based on differences and deepening contradictions; nostalgia for the Soviet past24. 
The main task of information and psychological influence is to change the attitudes of the individual. For this purpose, in the course of the "hybrid war", everything that is being spread by the Russian mass media on the territory of Ukraine today, especially in the eastern regions, is a frank picture distortion of reality. New, or rather dirty, methods and ways of waging this war are used: bribery, blackmail, intimidation, kidnapping, seizure of state facilities, local authorities and critical infrastructure, organization and conduct of terrorist acts. All this is accompanied by resonant acts of violence against the disobedient and manifestations of looting. The mechanism of informative and psychological influence is based on manipulating the consciousness of the masses and introducing purposeful misinformation into the consciousness25.
The main directions and methods of manipulative psycho-informational technologies of the Russian Federation in relation to Ukraine are:
- formation of a negative international image of Ukraine in order to weaken its geopolitical position;
- appropriate dosage and distortion of information in order to destabilize the situation in the state and implement its own policy of "controlled chaos";
- formation of a stereotype of insignificance and secondariness of Ukrainians, as well as the destruction of nationality and ethnic sense;
- dominance of the Russian language, culture and traditions for establishing self-identification while simultaneously displacing the Ukrainian language and culture26.
It should be noted that the object of information war is not just knowledge about events and socio-political processes, but significant meanings and values for society that "guide the course of life"27. Then, in the conditions of information aggression, a semantic war is waged, aimed at changing the thinking and behavior of the enemy by imposing distorted meanings and values. As P. Petrovsky notes, semantic war changes the beliefs and self-identification of a person and forms social values, political guidelines, principles and criteria for identifying and directing society that are beneficial to the aggressor.  Therefore, one of the priority directions of Russia's semantic war against Ukraine is the destruction of Ukrainian identity, which is inseparable from the awareness of deep involvement in its people, country and state28. The destruction of Ukrainian national identity by Russia is carried out by denying its essential features. This is manifested in an attempt to deprive Ukrainians of their genetic love of freedom, democracy and creativity. Therefore, Russia's information attacks against Ukraine on the destruction of Ukrainian national identity are aimed at: focusing on negative phenomena, distorted interpretation of history; spreading disinformation, pseudo-facts, fakes; blurring the prospects for the future; destroying the Ukrainian language, denying the state-patriotic identity of Ukrainians29.  Taking into account such challenges to the information security of Ukraine as the heterogeneity of the informative and cultural space of Ukraine and the lack of development of the national information infrastructure, the dispersion of the media market of Ukraine between private individuals – representatives of large business and the economic dependence of Mass Communication Media from owners; conducting special information operations by Russia in order to create a negative image of Ukraine in the world, the information dominance of Russia in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine, the priorities of state policy in the information sphere of Ukraine should be:
- Ukrainization of the information space, filling it with Ukrainian high-quality content, cultural and media products;
- providing state support for the creation of a national cultural product by making favorable conditions for creative self-realization of the individual through a variety of forms of artistic expression, intercultural dialogue, cultural exchange; 
- informing the Ukrainian society through social advertising about the main stages and experience of the Ukrainian state, promoting the values of freedom, democracy, patriotism, national unity and identity of the Ukrainian nation;
- promotion through the mass media of the integration of Ukrainian society on the basis of language, cultural tradition and historical memory, political consciousness of the Ukrainian ethnic group;
- stimulating the development of national production of text and audiovisual content;
- support of domestic book publishing;
- comprehensive support for the development of self-regulation mechanisms of mass media based on the principles of social responsibility;
- meeting the needs of the population of the temporarily occupied territories for objective, prompt and reliable information;
- full coverage of the territory of Ukraine with digital and internet broadcasting;
- popularization of Ukrainian cultural identity through the system of international cooperation in culture.

FORMATION OF NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS THROUGH THE SYSTEM OF NATIONAL AND PATRIOTIC EDUCATION IN UKRAINE
In the conditions of Russian aggression against Ukraine, the spread of separatist attitude, the incompleteness of the processes of Ukrainian nation formation, the heterogeneity of the informative and cultural space, the problems of forming national consciousness and patriotic values among Ukrainian citizens, respect for its cultural and historical past are relevant. National consciousness is one of the most important factors in the formation of a political nation. Priorities in the formation of the national consciousness of Ukrainian citizens are the definition of a system of basic values, the historical memory of the Ukrainian people, the linguistic unity of society, a single informative and cultural space, cultural policy, and patriotic education of citizens.
The concept of "Ukrainian national political record" reflects the process of creation or return to life of Ukrainian spirituality, Ukrainian national values ​​(national idea, the main component of which is the idea of ​​sovereignty of the Ukrainian nation and the Ukrainian nation, democratic ideal of socio-political system, awareness of natural rights, actualization of traditions of state formation and self-government) and related to the political sphere ethnic components of public consciousness (inherent in the Ukrainian language moral and ethical and socio-political concepts, terms, features of national character, patriotic feelings, historical memory, etc.). The process of formation of Ukrainian national political consciousness can be defined as the acquisition by public entities of Ukrainian national and ethnic qualities and features that reflect the fundamental interests of the Ukrainian ethnic group in creating their own national nationhood30. 
A significant role in the formation of national consciousness is played by the system of national and patriotic education. As noted by V. Lipinsky, It is best to overcome the internal organic weaknesses of Ukrainians and unite the Ukrainian nation on the basis of "territorial patriotism", i.e. awakening a sense of solidarity and unity of all permanent residents of Ukrainian land, regardless of their ethnic origin, class, religion, cultural level. The feeling of love for the native land - the Ukrainian land-fosterer as an organic whole, as the researcher believed, is a necessary and the only possibility of the most native connection of people in the world, which is called a nation31. Therefore, the system of national and patriotic education can be considered as one of the factors of nation formation and an element of the informative and cultural space.
In the process of national and patriotic education, a sense of citizenship is formed - a spiritual and moral value, which includes a sense of respect and love for the native state, political and moral responsibility, legal culture, self-awareness, respect and trust in compatriots. Citizenship manifests itself in the unity of civic consciousness and civic behavior ― in the awareness of one's belonging to the country, in active actions aimed at fulfilling one's public duties to society and the state, and acts as a criterion of personal maturity. Citizenship is also associated with the formation of a developed legal consciousness: law-abiding, legal culture, conscious and responsible attitude to the performance of their duties to society and the state32. 
The implementation of patriotic education in the state takes place in three stages: 
- formation of early ethnic self-awareness, which begins in the family by transmitting traditions and rituals;
- national and political self-awareness, which occurs under the influence of awareness of social life, the study of history and culture. A young man begins to think about the fate of his nation, he develops a sense of respect for his native country, a sense of national dignity;
- state and political self-awareness. A precondition for the successful formation of state patriotism is a sense of belonging to one's own nation and the development of one's own nationhood. In the conditions of a single state, a political nation is formed as the unity of all citizens of the country, regardless of their ethnicity33. 
According to the results of the national sociological survey of the Ilko Kucheriv Foundation "Democratic Initiatives" together with the Razumkov Center,  (December 13-18, 2019), Ukrainians consider love of their country (80%) and readiness to defend their country to be the main components of patriotism - with weapons (64%), educating children in love and respect for their country (58%), compliance with all laws of the country (56%), knowledge of the history of their country, its culture (51%)%. Somewhat less citizens consider patriotism to be participation in elections (38%), honest performance of their duties (36%), communication in the state language (35%), payment of taxes (30%), participation in public life (28%), respect for the authorities (26%), and the least part of citizens consider participation in the fight against corruption and other fault of the state (21%). Among the regional differences should be singled out the Western region, where communication in the state language was attributed to the priorities of patriotism (60%), but in other regions this component was less important in public opinion (32% – in the Central Region, 25% – in the Southern and 24% – in the Eastern). But such a component as respect for the authorities is significantly more attributed to patriotism in the Eastern Region (42%) than in the rest (28% in the South, 20% in the Center and 16% in the West). The recognition of the importance of paying taxes for patriotism also differs regionally: 41% in the Eastern Region, 36% in the Southern Region, 25% in the Central region, and 24% in the Western region34.
The absolute majority of the population of Ukraine (75%), according to this survey, considers themselves primarily citizens of Ukraine, regional identification (belonging to a region, district, city or village) as the main one was chosen much less – 16% of citizens. Moreover, national identification prevails in all regions of Ukraine: Southern (84%), Central (78%), Western (76%) and Eastern (66%). However, in the Eastern Region, 7% consider themselves primarily citizens of the former USSR. Nationwide identification has increased significantly since 2013 (December 2013 – 54%, December 2014 – 73%)35.
Considering the challenges to national security, Ukraine needs a qualitatively new approach to national and patriotic education of young people. After all, we are talking about issues of national security – the formation of national consciousness and love for homeland. 
The implementation of national and patriotic education is carried out through:
- affirmation in the minds of citizens of patriotic values, beliefs and respect for the cultural and historical past of Ukraine; 
- education of respect for the Constitution of Ukraine, laws of Ukraine, state symbols; 
- formation of citizens ' readiness to defend Ukraine; 
- cultivation of the best features of the Ukrainian mentality – hard work, freedom, justice; 
- formation of respect for the Ukrainian language as the state language and the language of interethnic communication; 
- encouraging active counteraction to separatism.
National and patriotic education in Ukraine, which applies not only to children and young people, but to all age groups, should be carried out through:
- improvement of the regulatory framework of the system of national and patriotic education;
- increasing the role of the Ukrainian language as a national value and an integral element of national and patriotic education, implementing measures to promote it;
- providing support for Ukrainian-language children's and youth print publications aimed at educating the younger generation in the spirit of patriotism, respect for the historical past and spiritual and cultural heritage;
- popularization and distribution of Ukrainian-language cultural products;
- implementation of projects and activities aimed at increasing the prestige of military service;
- streamlining and improving the system of preconscription military training;
- introduction of academic disciplines of spiritual and moral direction, which are based on the traditions of the Ukrainian state;
- assistance in the creation of national and patriotic education centers;
- organization and coordination of information and educational work in the field of national and patriotic education36.
Through the system of national and patriotic education, the spiritual security of the nation is formed, which contributes to the safe and stable functioning of society as an integral socio-cultural system based on its cultural potential. Within the framework of spiritual security, the cultural potential of society is recreated and developed, its historical memory is preserved, basic values are transmitted to the younger generation, and stable ideological attitudes are developed that do not allow to manipule public consciousness. Therefore, in the process of national and patriotic education, it is necessary to take into account the challenges facing Ukrainian society in the informative and cultural space, and direct efforts to form a high national and patriotic consciousness among Ukrainian citizens, a sense of belonging to the Ukrainian state and loyalty. 

Summary (attention! Translate into Polish and English)
The formation of the Ukrainian civil nation is based on the ethnic core – ethno-cultural and linguistic identity, the historical heritage of the Ukrainian titular nation. However, at the present stage, the processes of nation-formation in Ukraine are negatively affected by a number of factors, in particular, in the information and cultural sphere. The key ones are: the loss of the titular state-forming nation's ethnic identity based on the language factor, the heterogeneity of the information and cultural space, the information war of Russia against Ukraine, and the lack of an effective system for forming national consciousness. In particular, some citizens who identify themselves as Ukrainians consider Russian rather than Ukrainian to be their native language, as evidenced by the data of sociological surveys conducted in 2017, 2019. In Ukraine, there is no integral Ukrainian-speaking space, and foreign (primarily Russian-speaking) cultural products dominate over Ukrainian ones; there is an artificial politicization of the language issue. There is a negative impact of information flows of foreign states on the formation of the informative and cultural space of Ukraine, in particular Russia, which wages an information and psychological war aimed at inciting interethnic hostility in Ukraine, humiliating the Ukrainian language and culture, changing the thinking and behavior of Ukrainians. In the conditions of Russian aggression against Ukraine, the problems of forming national consciousness and patriotic values among Ukrainian citizens are relevant. 
Countering threats to the Ukrainian nation in the information and cultural sphere is possible through: implementation of national measures in the field of state language policy aimed at establishing respect for the Ukrainian language as the state and languages of national minorities, the development of Ukrainian content in the media space and on the Internet; Ukrainization of information and cultural space, ensuring state support for the creation of a national cultural product; promotion through the mass media of the integration of Ukrainian society based on the language, culture, historical memory and political consciousness of the Ukrainian ethnic group. The system of national and patriotic education should play a significant role in the formation of national consciousness. Its priority should be the formation of a value attitude of citizens to Ukraine as a Homeland state, the unity of the Ukrainian nation based on a common culture, language, traditions, a single ideological, state-political, and economic national space.
